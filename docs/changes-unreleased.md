## Stable and Nightly update channels

By @Ameyanagi in [PR #82](https://github.com/Ameyanagi/ReShiki/pull/82), under review.

Choose **Stable** or **Nightly** in **Check for updates**. ReShiki remembers the channel and preserves your automatic-check preference. Stable remains the default and uses verified installation; Nightly downloads the portable archive for your computer for manual installation. Switching back to Stable offers the latest stable release even when its version number is lower than the installed nightly.

Application-renderer example with automatic checking disabled. Separate desktop checks verified channel persistence and the downloaded nightly archive; see the [validation record](changes/update-channel.md).

## Windows GPU rendering and nightly builds

By @Ameyanagi in [PR #68](https://github.com/Ameyanagi/ReShiki/pull/68).

Windows builds include WGPU with a Tiny Skia fallback. CPU-only environments keep
the direct software renderer, and explicit renderer overrides remain available
for testing. The [validation record](windows-gpu-validation.md) includes Windows
VM measurements and real Radeon GPU rendering on Linux; physical Windows GPU
performance remains unmeasured.

Development PRs target `main`. Successful nightly builds publish unsigned portable
prereleases for all six platforms, with unique versions and checksums. Stable
releases use version tags on tested commits in `main`.

## Website videos and reusable color palettes

By @Ameyanagi in [PR #59](https://github.com/Ameyanagi/ReShiki/pull/59).

The home page now includes the full ReShiki tour, with a separate release-highlights video in the 0.9.1 notes. The README links to both videos.

The new [color palette reference](https://reshiki.com/guide/color-palettes/) compares all 118 elements in Presentation, Pastel and Jmol, in both light and dark mode. Copy exact RGB or derived OKLCH values, or download JSON, CSV, CSS variables and native theme files. A regression test checks the published data against ReShiki’s color code.

The palette panel follows its Light / Dark toggle independently of the website interface. Select an element to inspect its color, or choose paper, ink and ring-fill swatches.
