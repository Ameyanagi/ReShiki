# Unreleased changes

The Windows dropdown fix is recorded in [ReShiki 0.9.1](changes-0.9.1.md). Publisher-style, theme, clipboard and aromatic-fusion updates are recorded in [ReShiki 0.9.0](changes-0.9.md).

## ChemDraw caption exchange (under review)

By @Ameyanagi.

Formula captions remain editable text when copied into ChemDraw, and binary
CDX preserves their line spacing. Actual macOS clipboard round trips retain
all six tested molecules and twelve captions. The
[validation record](changes/chemdraw-caption-exchange.md) documents the captured
files and the remaining caption-position and legacy-file limitations.

## Windows GPU rendering and nightly builds

By @Ameyanagi in [PR #68](https://github.com/Ameyanagi/ReShiki/pull/68).

Windows builds include WGPU with a Tiny Skia fallback. CPU-only environments keep
the direct software renderer, and explicit renderer overrides remain available
for testing. The [validation record](windows-gpu-validation.md) includes Windows
VM measurements and real Radeon GPU rendering on Linux; physical Windows GPU
performance remains unmeasured.

Development PRs target `main`. Successful nightly builds publish unsigned portable
prereleases for all six platforms, with unique versions and checksums. Stable
releases use version tags on tested commits in `main`.

## Website videos and reusable color palettes

By @Ameyanagi in [PR #59](https://github.com/Ameyanagi/ReShiki/pull/59).

The home page now includes the full ReShiki tour, with a separate release-highlights video in the 0.9.1 notes. The README links to both videos.

The new [color palette reference](https://reshiki.com/guide/color-palettes/) compares all 118 elements in Presentation, Pastel and Jmol, in both light and dark mode. Copy exact RGB or derived OKLCH values, or download JSON, CSV, CSS variables and native theme files. A regression test checks the published data against ReShiki’s color code.

The palette panel follows its Light / Dark toggle independently of the website interface. Select an element to inspect its color, or choose paper, ink and ring-fill swatches.
